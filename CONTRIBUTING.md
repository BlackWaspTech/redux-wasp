## Contributing Code

### Git Workflow ([more information](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/))

All contributions must be offered via [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) and be approved by a maintainer.

### Code Style

There's no need to worry about style. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) has been configured, and it'll auto-format your code as soon as it's committed.

See the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) for more information.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

- Write tests for your code
- Pass the test for your code
- Add more tests to other people's code

We're running [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) for our test suite.

Available commands:

- `yarn test` / `npm test` to run all tests
- `yarn test:watch` / `npm run test:watch` to run the test watcher
- `yarn test:coverage` / `npm run test:coverage` to generate a coverage report
