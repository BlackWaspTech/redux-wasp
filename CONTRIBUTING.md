## Primary Goals

1 - Make it easy for developers to integrate GraphQL into existing client-side apps; reduce the need to heavily refactor a current state management solution
2 - Maintain as intuitive an API as possible
3 - Keep the package size small

## Test Suite: [`jest`](https://jestjs.io/en/)

Available commands:

- `npm run test` to run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` to run the test watcher
- `npm run test:coverage` to generate a coverage report

## Continuous Integration

- [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/)
